                EMULATOR
```

A nearly complete NES emulator in a single 750-line C++ source file, based on [LaiNES](https://github.com/AndreaOrru/LaiNES).

```
cloc main.cpp
       1 text file.
       1 unique file.                              
       0 files ignored.

## Features
- Cycle accurate
- Savestates (Beta, expect bugs!)
- Supports Mappers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7
- Extremely minimal: only 750 lines in one source file with no dependencies

## Usage
First, head over to the release tab and grab a release. Releases marked as `beta` may be unstable!

If a release doesn't work, you can also build it yourself, as described below.

### *nix systems
```sh
./badnes [path to ROM]
```

### Windows
Drag ROM over `badnes.exe`

Alternatively, use
```sh
badnes.exe [path to ROM]
```

## Controls
            UP  -  UP
          DOWN  -  DOWN
          LEFT  -  LEFT
         RIGHT  -  RIGHT
             A  -  A
             B  -  S
         START  -  ENTER
        SELECT  -  SPACE
    SAVE STATE  -  Q
    LOAD STATE  -  W

## Compatibility
BadNES implements the most common mappers, which should be enough for a good percentage of the games:
- NROM (Mapper 000)
- MMC1 / SxROM (Mapper 001)
- UxROM (Mapper 002)
- CNROM (Mapper 003)
- MMC3, MMC6 / TxROM (Mapper 004)
- AxROM (Mapper 007) (Beta, expect bugs!)

You can check the compatibility for each ROM in the following list:

## Building
### Requirements
- C++11
- SDL2

### *nix systems
```sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Ta180m/BadNES && cd BadNES
g++ main.cpp -o badnes -std=c++11 -lSDL2main -lSDL2 -O3
```

### Windows
```sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Ta180m/BadNES && cd BadNES
g++ main.cpp -o badnes -std=c++11 -IC:\mingw\include\SDL2 -LC:\mingw\lib -w -Wl,-subsystem,windows -lmingw32 -lSDL2main -lSDL2 -O3
```

## FAQ
### Why the name?
http://www.usaco.org/index.php?page=viewproblem2&cpid=1041

### Why did you do this?
I really like LaiNES: it's very minimal and compact â€” but it has several dependencies, so I try to write the shortest NES emulator possible, in a single source file.

### There's no sound!
I'm working on it right now. You can also check out the `sound` branch, although it's still in a very early stage right now.

### What do you mean by "nearly complete"?
I'll say it's complete once I finish implementing the APU.

### This game doesn't work!
Check to make sure BadNES implements its mapper.

### Mapper 7 / Savestates / etc. doesn't work!
Those features are still in `beta` right now so expect bugs.
